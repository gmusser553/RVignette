## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
x<-1:10
meanx<-mean(x)
print(meanx)

f<-function(x){
  return(mean(x))
}
y<-f(x)
print(y)
```

```{python}
list1=[1,2,3]
print(list1)
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r}
#dialog box will come up so u can easily navigate to file
f<-file.choose()

#if you are having trouble w data in R, double check that it is the rihgt kind of data eg numeric, boolean, etc
```

```{r}
f <- curl("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/difiore/ADA-2019/master/Country-Data-2016.csv")
d <- read.csv(f, header = TRUE, sep = ",", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
d <- as_tibble(d)  # I like tibbles!
head(d)

library(skimr)
library(kableExtra)
s <- skim(d)  # the main `skimr()` function
s <- skim_to_wide(d)  # formats results to a wide table
s %>% select(-type, -n, -n_unique, -empty) %>% kable() %>% kable_styling(font_size = 10)

#can do :
kable(s)
```
